The images in this folder were all created by the following procedures:

1. subtract the pedestal
2. find a kLB image that is closest in samx position to the data
3. find out the exposure time of the data and kLB and scale the kLB
4. subtract the kLB
5. save the resultant image as temp.tif
6. load in temp.tif, flipx it, and shift by +19 pixels in x 
7. add temp.tif to the kLB subtracted data
8. multiply the data by 0.5
9. apply the second order two box method
   b1 221 821 240 950
   b2  71 971 240 950
10. save the image as dopcpe???.tif, where dopcpe_???_cz.tif is the raw data

For each image, the beam z position was found from a qz swath, and D-spacing was
calculated. sig_back was calculated from dopcpe???.tif for each image.
