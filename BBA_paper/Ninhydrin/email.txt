Hi Kiyo,

I've attached a copy of the protocol I followed as well as the results I 
generated and the calculations. Just so you have an idea of exactly what I did: 
I dissolved each of the samples you gave me in 100 ul of sterile filtered 
water. I used this solution as a 1:1 dilution and also made a 1:2 dilution from 
it. For each time I ran the ninhydrin assay, I used two different volumes from 
each dilution (20 ul and 10 ul) to get a range of concentrations to be 
averaged.  For each tube of peptide you gave me, I was able to run the 
ninhydrin assay twice so each of the 3 separate results I generated are based 
on the averages of two experimental set ups. In order to perform these 
calculations, I made a standard curve based on known molarities of a leucine 
standard, so for each test, I generated a new leucine standard curve. 
Basically, I found that for 1.3 mg of Tat dissolved in 100 ul of water, the 
concentration was about 2.1 uM and for 1.0 mg of Tat dissolved in the same 
volume, the concentration was about 1.2 uM. If there is anything you would like 
me to clarify, please let me know.
